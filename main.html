                <label class="main-title">EXPERIENCES</label>
                <span class="experience-span">I became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During my Prague stay, I wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.</span>

                <span class="experience-span">Before that, By 1908, I was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after I gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended me to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. I was appointed associate professor in 1909.</span>

                <span class="experience-span">When the "Manifesto of the Ninety-Three" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany's militarism and position during the First World War— I was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic "Manifesto to the Europeans".</span>

                <span class="experience-span">Before that, In July 1912, I returned to my alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, I was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where I taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. I also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which I worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.</span>
